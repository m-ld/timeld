# live shared timesheets

**timeld** is a tool for managing your time.

- Quickly record tasks in a timesheet, as you work on them, or with a start and end time, or a duration
- See and edit your tasks on any device

The [desktop tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/timeld-cli) (called **timeld-cli**) is used to create and edit timesheets, and works on on MacOS, Windows and Linux.
