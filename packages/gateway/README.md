# timeld Gateway

The timeld Gateway is a service to manage timeld accounts and persist timesheets safely. It can be deployed and scaled easily on a cloud platform.

## Fly.io Deployment Notes

### prerequisites

```bash
git clone https://github.com/m-ld/timeld
cd timeld
cd packages/gateway
```

Install `flyctl` from https://fly.io and create a fly.io account (requires a creditcard).

Sign up for Ably, create an app in the Ably dashboard, and look for the root key and the api key.

Sign up for Courier and copy the authorization token that gets generated.

Paste your Ably and Courier tokens into your `.env` file as described below.

### volumes

A volume is required for clone persistence (Gateway and Timesheet domains).

```bash
flyctl volumes create timeld_data --region lhr
```

The first time you run this command, it will output:
```
Error Could not find App "timeld"
```

Run `flyctl launch`, that will complain:
```
Error Mounts source volume "timeld_data" does not exist
```
Now you can create the volume by running and then `flyctl deploy`.

> A volume is directly associated with only one app and exists in only one region.

Each _instance_ of an app must have dedicated storage. So we can either:
- [x] set `fly scale ... --max-per-region=1` (limits scaling), or
- [ ] create a directory under `/data` per [allocation ID](https://fly.io/docs/reference/runtime-environment/#fly_alloc_id) â€“ (creates a garbage collection problem with rolling redeploy)

### secrets

```bash
flyctl secrets import < .env
```

Where the .env file contains:
- `TIMELD_GATEWAY_ABLY__KEY={your root ably key}`
- `TIMELD_GATEWAY_ABLY__API_KEY={your ably control API key}`
- `TIMELD_GATEWAY_COURIER__AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN={your courier auth token}`

### deploy

_If you have made any changes to timeld-common, it needs to be published first._

```bash
flyctl deploy
```

The first deployment of a new Gateway must be started with the `genesis` flag. (You also have to include the gateway, because of a [Fly.io bug](https://github.com/superfly/flyctl/issues/560).)

```bash
flyctl deploy --env TIMELD_GATEWAY_GENESIS=true --env TIMELD_GATEWAY_GATEWAY=<your-app-id>.fly.dev
```

### random

- `engines.node` is set to 16.x in `package.json` due to a [bug in Restify](https://github.com/restify/node-restify/issues/1888).
- `simple-peer` is a dependency even if we don't use WebRTC (a bug in m-ld-js/ext/ably).
